/* Problem 2: Play with Expressions
Create a program that calculates the result of the following expression:
(a + b) * c / d - e
Take the above variables a, b, c, d, and e and store the value according to you
then store the result of the above expression in a separate variable and print
the result using console.log(). */

var a=12, b=3, c=4, d=5, e=6, f;     //change the value and check the result.
f=(a+b)*c/d-e
console.log(f);
